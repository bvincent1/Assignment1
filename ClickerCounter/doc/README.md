Workspace for clicker counter

Currrently built under android API level 16
Tested under JellyBean and Gingerbread

Stability Issues:
Currentely there is a know bug realated to the delete methode where the method crashes the app and renders it 
 unusable until the app is reinstalled. The reason for this is not obvious and the bug isn't constant. It does
 occur more offent when dealing with relatively large numbers of counters.
